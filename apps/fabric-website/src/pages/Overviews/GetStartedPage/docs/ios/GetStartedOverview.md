Fluent UI iOS is an [open-source](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-apple) native library that provides the Fluent UI experience for the iOS platform. It contains information about colors and typography, as well as custom controls and customizations for platform controls, all from the official Fluent design language used in Microsoft 365 products.

### Controls

Fluent UI iOS includes an expanding library of controls written in Swift and supporting Objective-C. These controls implement the Fluent Design language and provide consistency across Microsoft experiences.

Documentation for the controls is a work in progress. Some controls can be found in the [Controls section](#/controls/ios) of this site, and the full list can be viewed in [this source folder](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-apple/tree/master/ios/FluentUI).

### More information

Setup instructions and more information can be found in [the library's readme](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-apple/blob/master/ios/README.md).
